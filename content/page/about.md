# About Ian Philpot

Hey, Iâ€™m Ianâ€”a Principal Engineering Manager at [Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com), working in the [Azure](https://portal.azure.com). My career has taken me deep multiple industries like energy, transportation, and public sector and now into AI-driven engineering. 

## A Few Fun Facts About Me:
- I married my best friend over 20 years ago. Still the best decision Iâ€™ve ever made.
- Iâ€™ve got three incredible kids who keep life interesting.
- I volunteer in AV at my churchâ€”tech isn't just my job, it's part of who I am.
- I ride my mountain bike every chance I get. Trails > roads. 
- I write code in a tmp directory, play with it, then throw it away. Learning is the goal.
- I don't do side projects... until I do. And when I do, I go all in.

## My Two Passions: Cycling & AI Engineering

Lately, Iâ€™ve been gearing my brand toward two things that drive me: **cycling coaching** and **AI engineering**. 

### ðŸš´ Cycling Coaching
I've been cycling for yearsâ€”racing, training, and pushing limits. As a former Ironman triathlete, I know what it takes to set ambitious goals and achieve them. I love helping others optimize their training, balance data with feel, and get stronger on the bike.

Right now, I'm exploring ways to merge AI with cyclingâ€”whether it's smarter training insights, AI-powered coaching, or tools to make cyclists better, faster, and more efficient.

### ðŸ¤– AI Engineering
On the AI side, I'm deep into **building agents**â€”specifically for cycling performance and **developer productivity**. AI has the power to transform how we train, how we code, and how we work. 

At Microsoft, I'm helping my teams integrate **AI-powered developer tools** into our workflows, making us more efficient and innovative. AI isnâ€™t just a buzzwordâ€”itâ€™s a force multiplier.

This blog is where I share insights, ideas, and experiments at the intersection of **AI, cycling, and engineering**. Whether you're here for training tips, AI discussions, or just to geek out on tech, welcome. 

Letâ€™s build. Letâ€™s ride. Letâ€™s push limits.
