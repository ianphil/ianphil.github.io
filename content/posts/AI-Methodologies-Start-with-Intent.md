## **A Practical Method: Work at the Intent Layer**

As AI tooling improves, natural language and lightweight specs are increasingly becoming the interface to system changes. Instead of starting from scratch, engineers and operators can delegate first drafts to agents and focus on architecture, correctness, and integration. The goal isn't to replace judgment, but to apply more of it where it has the most leverage.

**Habits:**

- Start with intent: a short spec, constraints, and acceptance criteria
- Ask the agent for a plan, then an implementation
- Have it generate verification steps and run checks
- Review for readability, security, and operability
- Iterate with feedback and document key tradeoffs
