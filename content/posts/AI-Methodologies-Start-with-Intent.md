## **A Practical Method: Work at the Intent Layer**

As AI tooling improves, natural language and lightweight specs are increasingly becoming the interface to software creation. Instead of starting with a blank file, engineers can delegate first drafts to coding agents and focus on architecture, correctness, and integration. The goal isn’t to replace engineering judgment, but to apply more of it where it has the most leverage.

**Habits:**

- Start with intent: a short spec, constraints, and acceptance criteria
- Ask the agent for a plan, then an implementation
- Have it generate tests and run them locally/CI
- Review for readability, security, and operability
- Iterate with feedback and document key tradeoffs
