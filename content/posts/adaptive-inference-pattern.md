## Blog Post 1: Introduction to the Adaptive Inference Pattern

### Overview

The Adaptive Inference Pattern is a modern design pattern tailored for AI agents that call external tools. It handles the fuzzy, probabilistic nature of AI reasoning and the uncertainties that come with interpreting user requests. Instead of following a rigid, one-size-fits-all approach, this pattern adapts to the situation—selecting the right tools, negotiating parameters with the user, and even self-correcting when things go awry.

## Blog Post 2: Probabilistic Intent Matching – Fuzzy Logic in Action

When dealing with user inputs, not every request neatly maps to a single tool. The **Probabilistic Intent Matching** concept embraces uncertainty by calculating confidence scores for each possible tool. Here’s how you might convert the intent classifier from JavaScript/TypeScript to Python:

```python
class IntentClassifier:
    def classify_intents(self, user_input: str, context: list, available_tools: list) -> list:
        intents = []
        for tool_name in available_tools:
            confidence = self.calculate_tool_relevance(user_input, context, tool_name)
            if confidence > 0.3:  # a low threshold to include possible options
                parameters = self.extract_parameters(user_input, tool_name)
                intents.append({
                    'tool_name': tool_name,
                    'confidence': confidence,
                    'parameters': parameters
                })
        # Sort intents by confidence in descending order
        return sorted(intents, key=lambda x: x['confidence'], reverse=True)

    def calculate_tool_relevance(self, user_input: str, context: list, tool_name: str) -> float:
        # Placeholder for a real implementation using pattern matching or ML models
        return 0.5

    def extract_parameters(self, user_input: str, tool_name: str) -> dict:
        # Extract entities and assign confidence scores to parameters
        # This is a stub for demonstration purposes
        return {}
```

In this post, we’ve seen how to let the AI “fuzzily” decide which tool might help with a given request, based on calculated confidence scores. This flexible approach means the AI isn’t locked into rigid rules—it adapts!

## Blog Post 3: Contextual Memory with Temporal Awareness

A conversation isn’t just a single message—it’s a series of interactions. **Contextual Memory** lets our AI agent remember past interactions and use that history to make better decisions. Here’s the Python version of a context memory system:

```python
import time

class ContextMemory:
    def __init__(self):
        self.short_term_memory = []  # List of recent interactions
        self.long_term_memory = {}   # High-confidence, longer-lasting info

    def add_user_input(self, user_input: str):
        self.short_term_memory.append({
            'type': 'user_input',
            'content': user_input,
            'timestamp': time.time()
        })
        self.prune_short_term_memory()

    def add_tool_results(self, results: list):
        for result in results:
            self.short_term_memory.append({
                'type': 'tool_result',
                'content': result,
                'timestamp': time.time()
            })
            # Store results with high confidence in long-term memory
            if result.get('success') and result['metadata']['confidence'] > 0.9:
                key = f"{'-'.join(result['metadata']['attributions'])}-{time.time()}"
                self.long_term_memory[key] = result['data']

    def get_context(self) -> list:
        # For simplicity, we return the short-term memory.
        # In a real scenario, you might weight items based on recency and relevance.
        return self.short_term_memory

    def prune_short_term_memory(self):
        MAX_STM_SIZE = 20
        if len(self.short_term_memory) > MAX_STM_SIZE:
            self.short_term_memory = self.short_term_memory[-MAX_STM_SIZE:]
```

This memory system helps keep conversations coherent and ensures that valuable information isn’t lost over time—even if it’s just been spoken.

## Blog Post 4: Self-Correcting Tool Execution – Handling Failures Gracefully

No system is perfect, and tools can sometimes fail. The **Self-Correcting Tool Execution** concept equips the AI with multiple strategies to handle failures. Here’s how you can convert the JavaScript version to Python:

```python
import asyncio

class AdaptiveTool:
    def __init__(self):
        self.strategies = {
            'primary': self.primary_strategy,
            'alternate': self.alternate_strategy
        }
        self.fallback_strategy = self.simple_approach

    async def execute(self, params: dict):
        errors = []
        try:
            return await self.strategies['primary'](params)
        except Exception as e:
            errors.append(e)
            print(f"Primary strategy failed: {str(e)}")
            try:
                return await self.strategies['alternate'](params)
            except Exception as e2:
                errors.append(e2)
                print(f"Alternate strategy failed: {str(e2)}")
                return await self.fallback_strategy(params)

    async def primary_strategy(self, params: dict):
        # Placeholder: simulate a failure
        raise Exception("Primary strategy not implemented")

    async def alternate_strategy(self, params: dict):
        # Placeholder: simulate a failure
        raise Exception("Alternate strategy not implemented")

    async def simple_approach(self, params: dict):
        # Fallback method that’s simple but reliable
        return "Result from simple approach"

    def get_attributions(self) -> list:
        return ["AdaptiveTool"]
```

By trying a primary approach, then an alternate, and finally a fallback, our agent remains resilient—ensuring that a failed attempt doesn't break the entire process.

## Blog Post 5: Tool Parameter Negotiation – Asking the Right Questions

Sometimes the AI needs to ask you for more details. **Tool Parameter Negotiation** is the process that allows the agent to figure out what additional information it needs. Here’s how you can do it in Python:

```python
class ParameterNegotiator:
    async def resolve_parameters(self, intent: dict, required_params: list, context_memory: ContextMemory) -> dict:
        # Identify missing parameters based on confidence levels
        missing_params = [
            param for param in required_params 
            if param not in intent['parameters'] or intent['parameters'][param]['confidence'] < 0.8
        ]
        
        if not missing_params:
            params = {name: data['value'] for name, data in intent['parameters'].items()}
            return {'resolved': True, 'params': params}

        # Try to infer missing parameters from context
        inferred_params = self.infer_from_context(missing_params, context_memory)
        still_missing = [param for param in missing_params if param not in inferred_params]

        if still_missing:
            follow_up_question = self.generate_parameter_question(still_missing, intent['tool_name'])
            return {'resolved': False, 'followUpQuestion': follow_up_question}

        # Combine provided and inferred parameters
        params = {name: data['value'] for name, data in intent['parameters'].items() if data['confidence'] >= 0.8}
        params.update(inferred_params)
        return {'resolved': True, 'params': params}

    def infer_from_context(self, missing_params: list, context_memory: ContextMemory) -> dict:
        # Placeholder: try to fill in missing parameters based on previous context
        return {}

    def generate_parameter_question(self, missing_params: list, tool_name: str) -> str:
        return f"Could you please provide more details for {', '.join(missing_params)} for {tool_name}?"
```

This negotiation process ensures that the agent only moves forward when it has enough confidence in the parameters it’s using. It’s like asking clarifying questions in a conversation—pretty handy, right?

## Blog Post 6: Real-World Benefits and Final Thoughts

### Why It Matters

The Adaptive Inference Pattern isn’t just academic—it offers some real-world benefits:

- **Graceful Degradation:** Even when confidence is low or a tool fails, the system falls back gracefully.
- **Progressive Enhancement:** Multiple strategies mean the agent can try sophisticated methods first and back off to simpler ones when needed.
- **Transparent Attribution:** Including metadata about tool execution helps explain the AI’s reasoning.
- **Contextual Learning:** By keeping track of conversation context, the AI continuously improves its responses.
- **Reduced Hallucination Risk:** Modeling confidence at every step reduces the risk of generating misleading outputs.

### Final Thoughts

This pattern represents a modern, adaptive approach for AI agents—one that mirrors how we humans often handle uncertainty. Whether you’re building a conversational agent or an automated tool invoker, embracing uncertainty (and then managing it smartly) is key to building robust, reliable systems.
