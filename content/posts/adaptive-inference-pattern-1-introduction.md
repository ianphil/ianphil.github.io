## Introduction to the Adaptive Inference Pattern

### Overview

The Adaptive Inference Pattern is a modern design pattern tailored for AI agents that call external tools. It handles the fuzzy, probabilistic nature of AI reasoning and the uncertainties that come with interpreting user requests. Instead of following a rigid, one-size-fits-all approach, this pattern adapts to the situation—selecting the right tools, negotiating parameters with the user, and even self-correcting when things go awry.
