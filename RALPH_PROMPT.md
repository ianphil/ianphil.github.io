# Task: Implement GitHub Issues Blog Comments (Full Implementation)

You are working autonomously using the Ralph Wiggum pattern. Each iteration, you should:

1. **Check what's been done** - Look at existing files, git status, todo list
2. **Pick ONE small task** from the plan and complete it
3. **Commit your work** with a descriptive message
4. **DO NOT declare victory** - The script will loop you back for the next task

## The Plan

Follow the COMPLETE implementation plan at:
`/home/cip/src/notes/notes/GitHub-Issues-Blog-Comments-Plan.md`

Work through ALL phases incrementally:
- **Phase 1**: Manual Backfill + Client-Side Display (MVP)
- **Phase 2**: GitHub Action Auto-Creation + Authenticated Commenting
- **Phase 3**: Advanced Features (reactions, moderation, search, etc.)

## Working Constraints

- **Working directory**: `/home/cip/src/ianphil.github.io`
- **Additional tools**: OAuth code available at `../tools` (already in your context)
- **Do not ask questions**: Make reasonable decisions based on the plan
- **Commit incrementally**: Commit after each file/small task completion
- **Use TodoWrite**: Track your progress with the todo list tool

## Current Iteration Instructions

1. Check git status to see what's already been done
2. Check if a todo list exists from previous iterations
3. Pick the NEXT incomplete task (start at Phase 1, Task 1.1 if nothing done yet)
4. Complete JUST THAT ONE TASK
5. Commit the changes
6. Update todo list marking that task complete

## Important

- Work incrementally - one file, one feature, one task at a time
- Each iteration should take 1-5 minutes
- Let the loop bring you back for the next task
- DO NOT try to complete multiple phases in one iteration
- Continue through ALL phases until the entire system is complete

Begin now with the next task.
