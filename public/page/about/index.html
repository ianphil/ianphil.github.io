   <meta name="description" content="About Ian Philpot
Hey, Iâ€™m Ianâ€”a Principal Engineering Manager at Microsoft, working in the Azure. My career has taken me deep multiple industries like energy, transportation, and public sector and now into AI-driven engineering.
A Few Fun Facts About Me:

I married my best friend over 20 years ago. Still the best decision Iâ€™ve ever made.
Iâ€™ve got three incredible kids who keep life interesting.
I volunteer in AV at my churchâ€”tech isn&rsquo;t just my job, it&rsquo;s part of who I am.
I ride my mountain bike every chance I get. Trails &gt; roads.
I write code in a tmp directory, play with it, then throw it away. Learning is the goal.
I don&rsquo;t do side projects&hellip; until I do. And when I do, I go all in.

My Two Passions: Cycling &amp; AI Engineering
Lately, Iâ€™ve been gearing my brand toward two things that drive me: cycling coaching and AI engineering.">

<h2 id="my-two-passions-cycling--ai-engineering">My Two Passions: Cycling &amp; AI Engineering</h2>
<p>Lately, Iâ€™ve been gearing my brand toward two things that drive me: <strong>cycling coaching</strong> and <strong>AI engineering</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="-cycling-coaching">ðŸš´ Cycling Coaching</h3>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been cycling for yearsâ€”racing, training, and pushing limits. As a former Ironman triathlete, I know what it takes to set ambitious goals and achieve them. I love helping others optimize their training, balance data with feel, and get stronger on the bike.</p>
<p>Right now, I&rsquo;m exploring ways to merge AI with cyclingâ€”whether it&rsquo;s smarter training insights, AI-powered coaching, or tools to make cyclists better, faster, and more efficient.</p>
<h3 id="-ai-engineering">ðŸ¤– AI Engineering</h3>
<p>On the AI side, I&rsquo;m deep into <strong>building agents</strong>â€”specifically for cycling performance and <strong>developer productivity</strong>. AI has the power to transform how we train, how we code, and how we work.</p>
<p>At Microsoft, I&rsquo;m helping my teams integrate <strong>AI-powered developer tools</strong> into our workflows, making us more efficient and innovative. AI isnâ€™t just a buzzwordâ€”itâ€™s a force multiplier.</p>
<hr>
<p>This blog is where I share insights, ideas, and experiments at the intersection of <strong>AI, cycling, and engineering</strong>. Whether you&rsquo;re here for training tips, AI discussions, or just to geek out on tech, welcome.</p>
<p>Letâ€™s build. Letâ€™s ride. Letâ€™s push limits.</p>
